# Entity vs Types

In GraphQL, the terms "type" and "entity" can have distinct meanings, especially when GraphQL is used in the context of broader application frameworks or systems like Apollo, Hasura, or GraphQL implementations that interact with databases or other services. Let's break down the differences:

### 1. **Type (GraphQL Type)**
   - **Definition**: A "type" in GraphQL is a fundamental concept that defines the shape of data. It specifies the fields that an object can have and the types of those fields (e.g., `String`, `Int`, `Boolean`, or custom types). GraphQL types are used to define the schema, which describes what queries are possible and what data can be returned by the GraphQL server.
   - **Usage**: Types are used to structure and validate data. For example, you might define a `User` type that has fields like `id`, `name`, and `email`.
   - **Examples**:
     ```graphql
     type User {
       id: ID!
       name: String!
       email: String!
     }
     ```
   - **In summary**: A GraphQL type is a blueprint for the shape of data and how it's structured within the schema. It is not tied to a specific data source but defines how data is represented.

### 2. **Entity (in the Context of a Data Model or Application Architecture)**
   - **Definition**: An "entity" typically refers to a specific object or concept that exists in a database or a domain model. An entity usually corresponds to a row in a table in a relational database or a document in a NoSQL database. Entities are real-world objects or concepts with their own identity and attributes.
   - **Usage**: In systems that interact with databases (e.g., ORM-based systems, or services like Hasura or Apollo with data sources), an entity represents an actual piece of data stored in the database. For instance, a `User` entity would represent a specific user in the system with attributes like `id`, `name`, and `email`.
   - **Examples**:
     - In an ORM: A `User` entity might map directly to a `users` table in the database.
     - In DDD (Domain-Driven Design): An entity represents a core concept in the domain model, often with behavior and state.

   - **In summary**: An entity is a specific instance of data, usually tied to a data store or domain model, representing a concrete object or record with its own identity.

### Key Differences:

- **Abstract vs. Concrete**: A GraphQL type is an abstract definition of the shape of data, while an entity is a concrete instance of data in a database or domain model.
- **Purpose**: Types are used to define the schema and structure of data in GraphQL, while entities represent actual data stored in a system.
- **Data Binding**: Types are not necessarily tied to any data storage mechanism, whereas entities are often directly tied to a database or other persistent storage systems.
  
In some systems, especially those that combine GraphQL with database interactions (e.g., Hasura or certain Apollo integrations), types and entities might overlap, with GraphQL types closely reflecting the structure of entities in the underlying data model. However, conceptually, they serve different roles.
