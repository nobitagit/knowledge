Notes on the [Book](https://www.orellfuessli.ch/shop/home/artikeldetails/A1062234758?) by Tony Fadell.

- "I can't make you the smartest or the brightest, but I can make you the most knowledgeable." (ch. 1.3 at 2.38). Being the smartest is rarely achievable, but being the one with the deepest knowledge about something is possible by putting in the work. You can then surround yourself with people that are smarter.
- People won't remember how you joined, but how you left. So leave a company in good terms.
- (ch 3.1 00.00) The customer journey starts long before the customer gets their hand on your product and ends long after. Prototype the whole customer journey/experience, make the intangible tangible, so you can't overlook the showy but incredibly important parts of the journey (how customer discovers, evaluates, installs and even returns the product). It all matters. You should start considering their journey end to end, not just the core of the product.
- Use storytelling. Tell them a story they can connect with, to blend facts and feelings. You need enough insights that you are anchored in real facts.
- ch 3.5 (...) Kee your project small as long as you can, don't hire too many people. Don't overspend or allocate too much money to it. People do stupid things when given too many resources, they overdesign, overthink
- ch 3.5 (15.00) Set a **heartbeat** that works for your team. Big deliverables should be tied to a big event. That creates focus and helps reduce the clutter. This also introduces predictablity, which is a team dynamic that people like. We like to think we are not ruled by schedule, but most people appreaciate predictablity, to know when they should be head down, or have the time to look around.
- Predictability allows to create a living document about how we work.
