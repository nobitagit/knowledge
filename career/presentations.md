# Presentation tips

## [How to actually deliver a great presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaoxXFju6uo)

- have 3 to 5 main points. They need to have a natural flow in your head. No need to memorise
- Once you have these 3-5 points, write down all that's in your head under each bullet point. Goal is to get them out on paper to...
- ...**cut out all the stuff that doesn't contribute to your points effectively**
- do not memorise what you have written, rather sub-vocalise them, without visual cues
- Finally, memorise **word for word** the first and last sentence of the speech

## [Effectively communicate to c-suite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKzrdLVK5Ic&t=78s)

- C-suite are thinking far ahead into the future, so anchor your presentation in the future, not in the past.
- link to corporate objectives. What is the big objective you are solving? What is the real problem that my proposal solves?
- build the business case.
- be mindful of the c-suite goals and objectives they care the most about (eg. AI)
- they need to see the value from their lenses
