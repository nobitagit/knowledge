# System Design

## Workflow

1. Understand exactly what the system does. If you can look at an example, that's better.
2. **Clarify requirements:**
   - Functional Requirements
   - Non-Functional Requirements (performance, security, scalability)
3. **Estimate.** Starting from some ballpark numbers write your expectations.
4. **Define the APIs**:
   - Endpoints that we expose
   - Parameters
   - Returns
5. Design the DB schema
6. Pick a DB. Relational vs non-relational.
7. **Dig into the problem** to solve the principal challenges.
8. How to scale the DB?
9. Caching
10. Load Balancing
11. Telemetry and analytics
12. Security
