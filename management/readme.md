# Management

> When you see a teammate struggling, are you one of the first people to go over and offer a hand? That’s a sign.

## Manage time and calendar

- Don't let other people create events on your own calendar
- When a meeting is requested, ask if it can be solved with an email or a slack conversation
- Stack meetings on specific days
- Try and keep all the related events on the same day. If you have a meeting about X, if possible try and work on X on that same day
- Schedule **everything** in the calendar

> Each Sunday afternoon (or Friday afternoon), write down your top 3 priorities for the week and design your calendar to spend 80%+ of your time on those priorities.
>
> [source](https://themanagershandbook.com/managing-yourself)

Also, make use of G Cal reminders (not just events).

## Top goal

> A simple way of ensuring that you get your week's top three priorities accomplished is to block off a Top Goal event in your calendar for an hour every day. [...] Turn your phone on silent, turn off all notifications, and don't check email during this time.

## Color coding

Color code events by type.

> For example, use different colors for activities related to recruiting, one-on-ones, recurring sync meetings, customer meetings and time blocks.

## Proactively schedule time off and recreation time

> The small joys in life, say lunch with a friend or taking a long walk, tend to get squeezed out of calendars to make way for other people's priorities. It is important to proactively schedule these, otherwise they will never happen.
>
> This is especially critical for exercise. If you are planning to go the gym on Tuesdays and Thursdays, make sure that's in your calendar (and public to your team), otherwise meetings will replace that time. Make sure travel time is scheduled too.

## Energy audit

When feeling tired and burned out, review your meetings and events.
Split them:

1. Events that give you energy
2. Events that drain you

Goal: have more 1. than 2.
To reduce 2. hire and delegate where possible.

This is also a great exercise to do with your direct reports during their one-on-ones.

## Be on time & present

When a meeting is scheduled, **always** be on time.

> There is someone else on the other side of your agreement to start the meeting at a certain time. They have stopped what they are working on to attend the meeting on time. If you do not show up on time, they cannot start the meeting, but they also cannot leave, because they don’t know if you’ll show up the next minute or not.
>
> This is not only disrespectful but also counterproductive. If they are a customer, investor, or recruit, they will not engage with your company. If they report to you, they will keep quiet but resent you.
>
> There is no winning scenario when you waste someone’s time

When you know you'll be late, communicate it as soon as you can.

Be present means be prepared. Don't jump from meeting to meeting. Do a bit of prep beforehand.
To facilitate this, prefer 25 (rather than 30) and 50 (rather than 60) minutes events.
In case of back to back meetings this will give you the necessary time to prep or take a quick break and start the meeting with focus.

Google Cal has this feature. Look for "speedy meetings" in the settings.

When in meeting, **avoid** checking email and phone. Put the phone face down and consider airplane mode. This is not only for maximising attention, but also to send a message to the other attendees that the meeting is important.

## When you schedule a meeting

Write the details in the description, a list of things people have to go over during the call, if they need to make some prep, and - important - the expected outcome, which is in general a list of action points that are agreed and distributed.

Ex.

```
Meeting title: improve security documentation

Description:

Prepare some examples of documentation you find useful.
Address all the below points:

- Setting expectations
- Understand the audience of these docs
- Understand the tone & level of detail we want to use
- Showing/finding existing examples that we like
- Agreeing on a format we want to use
- Define action points for a follow up meeting
```

The meeting should always start with a review of the expectations for the same (basically read all of the above).

## GTD or Getting Things Done

We as humans are bad at remembering and organising mentally. That's why we need a system.

### Capture everything that has your attention

As soon as an idea that is worth remembering hits your mind record it.

An example of this might be:

- Organise lunch with Patrick
- Prepare a talk for all-hands
- Book sailing-school course

### Clarify

If it's a quick thing (less than 2 minutes), do it now.
If it's not actionable consider binning it.

### Use a task manager

[Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/) is powerful, but Any.do is enough for me.

### Batch async tasks

For instance, respond to emails in bulk, rather than as they come.
Use a label for those that need reply.
Consider turning off push notifications and bulk replying twice a day, at fixed times.

Consider restructuring the mail folders of Gmail.
Go to settings > Inbox > Inbox sections.
I have 4:

- important and unread
- labelled as "to reply"
- starred
- everything else

### Have a morning prep

Book a 25 minutes slot as first task of the day, where you batch the initial work to get into your work day.
Example:

- respond to emails
- check open PRs
- review kanban board tickets

### Top Goal time

> Schedule an hour each day (that is, put an Event in your calendar) to work on your Top Goal only.
>
> During this Top Goal time, do not respond to emails, texts, calls, and messages.
>
> You should decide on your top three goals for the week during your one-on-one with your manager.

### If you're procrastinating...

Do an energy audit on your calendar. What is draining you? Is there something that isn't quite right? Do you lack motivation?

## Coaching

Find a mentor.
Ensure that people in the company know who can help them with the different issues or struggles they might face.

Create an advisory board.
Many mentors that you consider reliable. Can be outside of the company.

## Good habits

- develop good habits (do sport, meditate, eat healthy)
- make a point to share these with the team. Make them public and set an example
- talk about this in 1:1s

I decided to cycle to work every day. Whatever the weather. That is around 1h of exercise every day while I commute.
I do meal prep day.

## Visualise and confront fear

Stoics used a visualization exercise they referred to as **negative visualisation** to train themselves to stay calm and free from emotional suffering in the face of adversity.

Contemplate what you have, and then visualize your life without those things. Imagine life without your significant other, or without your job, or without your health, and so on and so forth. Don't just think about it logically, really feel it deep down to your core.

First and foremost, this technique makes you quickly appreciate what you have in life: your health, your family, your opportunities, and more. Realizing how blessed you are can put things into perspective.

Second is the ability to set expectations up front and be far more honest with yourself. What could go wrong? How would you handle such scenarios? Can you overcome or plan for them?

## Self awareness

The goal is to understand that most things don't happen _to_ you, but _by_ you.
You are the driving force.

> The second way to grow in self-awareness is to create an incredibly feedback-rich environment where the people around you are giving you feedback -- the most direct form of it.

Take the enneagram test and review the result

> You are most likely a type 4.
>
> Taking wings into account, you seem to be a 4w5 or 6w7

Review the personal growth recommendations.

For instance:

> Avoid putting off things until you are "in the right mood." Commit yourself to productive, meaningful work that will contribute to your good and that of others, no matter how small the contribution may be. Working consistently in the real world will create a context in which you can discover yourself and your talents. (Actually, you are happiest when you are working—that is, activating your potentials and realizing yourself. You will not "find yourself" in a vacuum or while waiting for inspiration to strike, so connect—and stay connected—with the real world.
>
> Self-esteem and self-confidence will develop only from having positive experiences, whether or not you believe that you are ready to have them. Therefore, put yourself in the way of good. You may never feel that you are ready to take on a challenge of some sort, that you always need more time. (Fours typically never feel that they are sufficiently "together," but they must nevertheless have the courage to stop putting off their lives.) Even if you start small, commit yourself to doing something that will bring out the best in you.
