# Dev rel

## Developer triangle

1. Deliver on time
2. Easy to work with
3. Do great work

A lot of people meet 2 of the 3 points. The missing one creates tension in either the managers or the devs.
An outlier is the one who manages to find a balance between the 3.

## Complaints vs solutions

Suggest people to come up with solutions rather than complaints.

> We can't work like this because we never have time to add tests

Vs

> Let's ensure we add tests as acceptance criteria

## When in doubt, make it public

See https://blog.codinghorror.com/when-in-doubt-make-it-public/
Sharing your work all the time is a massive boost.

## Manufacture urgency

Commit to your actions.

- volunteer to present a topic you want to learn
- announce publicly you'll be doing X
- take on interviews for tech you don't know very well

## Introducing changes

A good way to propose and introduce changes is by RFCs.

- read this [article](https://engineering-management.space/post/rfc-driven-development/)
- see the rust [documentation](http://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/) about their RFC flow

## Prepare for onboarding

Onboarding is not just for junior engineers

> “At Shopify, in our division, we use the GitHub issues tag "great for new starters". These are typically lower priority bugs and tweaks that can be picked up at any time. This is true both at onboarding, when someone is looking for easy work, as well as when people change teams.”
