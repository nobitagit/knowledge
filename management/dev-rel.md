# Dev rel

## Developer triangle

1. Deliver on time
2. Easy to work with
3. Do great work

A lot of people meet 2 of the 3 points. The missing one creates tension in either the managers or the devs.
An outlier is the one who manages to find a balance between the 3.

## Complaints vs solutions

Suggest people to come up with solutions rather than complaints.

> We can't work like this because we never have time to add tests

Vs

> Let's ensure we add tests as acceptance criteria

## When in doubt, make it public

See https://blog.codinghorror.com/when-in-doubt-make-it-public/
Sharing your work all the time is a massive boost.

## Manufacture urgency

Commit to your actions.

- volunteer to present a topic you want to learn
- announce publicly you'll be doing X
- take on interviews for tech you don't know very well

## Introducing changes

A good way to propose and introduce changes is by RFCs.

- read ths [article](https://engineering-management.space/post/rfc-driven-development/)
- see the rust [documentation](http://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/) about their RFC flow
