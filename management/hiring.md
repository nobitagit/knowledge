# Hiring

## Ideas

- [Publish a page with requirements, suggestions & overview of the process](https://asana.com/eng/interview-guide)
- Always [define what you're looking for](https://asana.com/eng/interview-guide)
- Hire for [core values](./building-a-team.md)
- Screen **every interaction** (not just the interview, but they're way of writing, their email exchanges, how timely their communication is). A candidate is closer to their true self outside the interview timeframe. (Richard Branson once disguised himself as a taxi driver to [see how potential candidates would treat him](https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/blog/talent-connect/2016/richard-branson-secrets-to-recruiting-the-right-personality)). Get the employee walking and talking.

### Avoid siloed interviews

Debatable but interesting, taken from [here at 17:30](https://app.pluralsight.com/course-player?clipId=fd125e12-2e25-40a5-a750-db222264cfe4).

- you do one round, you notice the candidate is weak on 1 point
- you debrief and ask the subsequent interviews to focus on that point

## What are the characteristics you're looking for?

Apart from people matching your engineering team's core values, you want each hire to be a **team player**, that means to have ALL these 3 points:

- Humble
- Hungry
- People smart

Again, **all three** must be there. Otherwise if they are only:

- **hungry**: they are a bulldozer, they are not helpful
- **hungry** + **Humble**: miss social skills, they might not get the social cues or norms that really gel a team
- **humble** + **people smart**: the lovable slackers, they are very dangerous. They are likable and people like them, but they don't push the team forward. They never push anyone out of their comfort zone. They never argue. They will hold your team back. Very hard to fire.
- **people smart** + **hungry**: a politician that can manipulate people. Very selfish.
