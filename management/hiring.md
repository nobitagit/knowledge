# Hiring

> A resume correlates loosely with whether or not you know how to do a job

## Ideas

- [Publish a page with requirements, suggestions & overview of the process](https://asana.com/eng/interview-guide)
- Always [define what you're looking for](https://asana.com/eng/interview-guide)
- Hire for [core values](./building-a-team.md)
- Screen **every interaction** (not just the interview, but they're way of writing, their email exchanges, how timely their communication is). A candidate is closer to their true self outside the interview timeframe. (Richard Branson once disguised himself as a taxi driver to [see how potential candidates would treat him](https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/blog/talent-connect/2016/richard-branson-secrets-to-recruiting-the-right-personality)). Get the employee walking and talking.

### Avoid siloed interviews

Debatable but interesting, taken from [here at 17:30](https://app.pluralsight.com/course-player?clipId=fd125e12-2e25-40a5-a750-db222264cfe4).

- you do one round, you notice the candidate is weak on 1 point
- you debrief and ask the subsequent interviews to focus on that point

## What are the characteristics you're looking for?

Apart from people matching your engineering team's core values, you want each hire to be a **team player**, that means to have ALL these 3 points:

- Humble
- Hungry
- People smart

Again, **all three** must be there. Otherwise if they are only:

- **hungry**: they are a bulldozer, they are not helpful
- **hungry** + **Humble**: miss social skills, they might not get the social cues or norms that really gel a team
- **humble** + **people smart**: the lovable slackers, they are very dangerous. They are likable and people like them, but they don't push the team forward. They never push anyone out of their comfort zone. They never argue. They will hold your team back. Very hard to fire.
- **people smart** + **hungry**: a politician that can manipulate people. Very selfish.

## Questions

Potential Interview Questions to Help Identify the “Ideal Team Player”
During the 2019 New CED Training, County Extension Directors learned about the characteristics of
The Ideal Team Player (https://tablegroup.com/books/ideal-team-player): Humble, Hungry and
Smart. With the help of Nikki Kurdys and the behavioral-based interview questions she shared with
the CEDs, Extension Organizational Development offers the following as potential interview questions
to help CEDs identify the Humble, Hungry and Smart characteristics in their job candidates. In
addition, CEDs can look at Patrick Lencioni’s website (author of The Ideal Team Player) to view other
potential interview questions:
https://tablegroup.com/imo/media/doc/IdealTeamPlayerINTERVIEWQUESTIONS(11)singlepages.pdf
Please keep in mind this is not an exhaustive list, one does not need to ask all of these questions of
the job candidate, and additional interview questions need to be asked as well regarding technical
skills, etc. Also, we should always avoid asking any personal questions or questions that are not
associated with the job (i.e., questions regarding race, family, religion, personal choices, politics, etc.)
Questions from Behavioral-Based Sample Interview Questions Nikki Kurdys Shared:
HUMBLE:
● Discuss a time when your integrity was challenged. How did you handle it?

● Give me an example of a time you made a sacrifice to improve yourself.

● Tell me about a situation in which you had to go above and beyond the call of duty in order to get a job done.
