# Mentoring

From ["Growing a Junior-Heavy Team"](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/5f4113a9-49a9-4bda-a3d4-40d7a8c041db)

Coach senior engineers on how to be better mentors. While pairing junior engineers with more experienced people is a good idea, don’t assume that all seniors know how to be supportive mentors. Behaviors supportive and efficient mentors share include:

- Avoiding serving up answers on a plate.
- Listening to what the mentee has to say.
- Discussing specific situations and going deeper with them.
- Providing context and perspective for the specific situation or challenge.
- Leveraging the mentor’s network to help the mentee. Especially powerful at larger companies.
- Being supportive and giving the mentee peace of mind that their mentor is on their side.

At larger tech companies, pull in help from other teams. Help can include code reviews, mentoring, or even loaning experienced engineers for a few months. Getting help is where having strong connections with your peer managers is an asset. It’s also where a supportive manager chain makes a difference.
An idea could be to nominate a senior dev from another team to do code reviews for each new junior developer. So they get insights from different people and they learn different review styles. Ask for opinions in different coding styles.
