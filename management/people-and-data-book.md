# People and data

[Tom Redman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomredman/) book notes.

- Data imprtance is growing every day, but it's very hard to put it at work. Moreover, there's a lot of bad data around that increases the noise and reduces the effetiveness of people. _Better management of data is THE management challenge of the 21st Century_.

- It is very hard to sustain a competitve advantage based solely on technology. Any competitor can buy the same technology. But the data of a company is unique to itself _It is THE differentiator._

- A company can't do much with its data without getting as many people as it can fully onboard. Without large numbers of people engaged in the data programme, poor results, even outright failure, is probable. This is why involving **regular people** in the process is key. They are central to all data-related work.

- Yet today, too many companies view people as ‘part of the problem’.

> Everyone thinks about people last, when it is too late to engage them.

It is as if everyone's job has two components:

- their jobs
- dealing with mundane data issues so they can do their jobs

It is a huge waste of talent.

## Involving regular people early on

Never work in isolation.

- Every datascience project should start with the question, ‘Who might be impacted and **how do we get them involved?**'

- Every effort to address data quality must start with the question, "Who touches that data and **how do we get them involved**?"

- Every effort to improve business performance must start with the question, ‘What data do we need to complete this effort and **who do we need to get involved**?’

- Data is a team sport, requiring unprecedented coordination among regular people

> The issues start with confusion about the proper roles of data versus the information technologies that help create, store, transport and process the data. In particular, too many people conflate the two, or worse, subordinate data to tech. An unhealthy dynamic ensues in which the business develops unrealistic expectations of its IT department, which then fails to deliver, reducing business's trust in IT.

[...]

> some simple steps can begin the process. It starts with understanding that data and IT are different sorts of assets that require different styles of management. This leads to more realistic expectations of information technologists, which should include providing basic storage, transport and processing capabilities, and automating well-defined processes to increase scale and decrease unit costs. With these foundations, more aggressive digital transformations, and simpler, more powerful, better data architectures to promote advanced data science can follow.
