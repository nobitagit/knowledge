## Notes

Corrective feedback:

From [this video](https://youtu.be/jhtwqK3iOV8?t=249). Orient Behaviour Impact and Question

- keep it short, it helps avoid awkwardness
- orient the situation. "in this morning call...", "When you were talking to Chris"
- point out the behaviour using **nouns and verbs**. Avoid **adjectives**. "You interrupted me 4 times" vs. "you were rude".
- up to this point it has to be a very neutral, objective talk. No new information, everything is factual ("I'm telling you interrupted me" vs "I'm telling you were rude")
- and now we shift to giving **new information**, ie. how that behaviour made you feel. Feedback if about you. You are giving the person insights about how **you** perceived the situation. "I started losing track of where I was in my presentation". Lots of adjectives, lots of emotion here. Because you are telling new info about **yourself**, so you are entitled to that.
- finally, we shift the focus from us to them. We do this by asking an open ended question. NOT a question that starts with "why", because that's accusatory. "What do you think"/"How do you see it"

If the feedback is not taken well, you get to say reinforce that "this was my experience of it, that's how I felt" and there's no way to change that, there's no right or wrong in having a feeling.
