# Good strategy, bad strategy

Notes taken from the Audiobook by Richard Rumelt.

There is a clear distinction between goals, vision, and strategy. These concepts, while interrelated, serve different purposes and should not be confused.

## 1. Goals

Definition: Goals are specific, measurable objectives or targets that an organization or individual wants to achieve.

- Nature: Concrete, time-bound, and often numerical.
- Purpose: Serve as milestones or benchmarks to measure progress.
- Misconception: Goals are not strategies. Declaring what you want to achieve (e.g., “increase revenue by 20%”) does not explain how you will achieve it.

Example in the book: A company aiming to “become the market leader in 3 years” has set a goal, but this is not a strategy. The strategy outlines how they will reach this leadership position.

## 2. Vision

Definition: Vision is an aspirational description of what an organization or individual seeks to become or achieve in the long term.

- Nature: Broad, motivational, and inspirational.
- Purpose: Provides direction and purpose, acting as a guiding star for long-term aspirations.
- Misconception: Vision is not strategy. While a vision inspires, it does not provide the practical steps needed to achieve it.

Example in the book: A company stating “we aim to revolutionize the technology industry” has a compelling vision, but this is not a strategy. It lacks specificity and actionable plans.

## 3. Strategy

Definition: Strategy is a coherent plan of action designed to overcome significant challenges or achieve specific objectives by leveraging resources and addressing constraints.

- Nature: Analytical, focused, and actionable.
- Purpose: Provides the “how” — the path to move from the current situation to the desired goal or vision.
- Structure: Strategy comprises the diagnosis (understanding the challenge), guiding policy (approach to addressing it), and coherent action (specific steps).

Example in the book: If the goal is “increase market share by 15%,” the strategy might involve a diagnosis of weak distribution networks, a guiding policy to prioritize partnerships with key retailers, and coherent actions like expanding supply chain capacity and launching marketing campaigns.

## Key Differences

| **Aspect**    | **Goals**                 | **Vision**                        | **Strategy**                              |
| ------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**   | Specific targets          | Inspirational long-term direction | Practical plan to achieve goals or vision |
| **Focus**     | What needs to be achieved | Why we are doing this             | How we will achieve it                    |
| **Timeframe** | Short-to-medium term      | Long-term                         | Medium-to-long term                       |
| **Nature**    | Measurable and concrete   | Aspirational and broad            | Analytical, logical, and actionable       |
| **Role**      | Measure success           | Inspire and motivate              | Provide direction and focus               |

- Many organizations mistakenly conflate goals or vision with strategy, leading to what Rumelt calls “bad strategy.” Simply stating ambitions or declaring lofty visions without providing actionable plans creates empty rhetoric.
- Good strategy, in contrast, bridges the gap between goals and vision by addressing the underlying challenges and identifying a practical path forward.

## Ch. 5 “The Kernel of Good Strategy”

introduces the essential elements of a good strategy, which the author refers to as “the kernel.” A strong strategy is built around three interrelated components: diagnosis, guiding policy, and coherent action.

## 1. Diagnosis

Understanding the Problem:

- A good strategy begins with a clear, insightful diagnosis of the situation. This involves identifying and understanding the key challenges or problems that must be addressed.
- Diagnosis simplifies the complexity of reality by focusing attention on the most critical factors.
- Example: In a competitive market, a diagnosis might involve recognizing that the company’s cost structure is its biggest disadvantage.

Note that disagosing the correct problem is far from trivial, as any complex system has multiple problems. It is imperative to boil down to the real, most important and blocking issue.

## 2. Guiding Policy

Setting the Direction:

- The guiding policy provides an overarching approach to deal with the diagnosis. It is a general principle or direction that guides decision-making and resource allocation.
- A guiding policy should be specific enough to be actionable but not overly rigid. It is the “how” of addressing the diagnosis.
- Example: If the diagnosis is about high costs, the guiding policy might focus on achieving operational efficiency rather than competing on features.

## 3. Coherent Action

Coordinated Steps:

- Coherent action involves the specific, coordinated steps that implement the guiding policy. These actions must work together to solve the diagnosed problem.
- Good strategies ensure that actions are aligned with the guiding policy and are not contradictory or scattered.
- Example: To achieve cost efficiency, actions might include automating production, renegotiating supplier contracts, and redesigning products to reduce material usage.

Key Takeaways:

- A good strategy is not a collection of goals or ambitions; it is a logical structure that links diagnosis, guiding policy, and coherent action.
- Each component of the kernel reinforces the others. The diagnosis informs the guiding policy, which in turn shapes the coherent action.
- The kernel distinguishes good strategy from bad strategy, which often lacks focus, coherence, or a realistic understanding of the problem.
