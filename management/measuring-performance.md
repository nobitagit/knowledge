# Measuring performance

- [Great article from Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/blog/2020/10/06/implementing-four-key-metrics-contentful/)
- [Gitlab KPIs page](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/performance-indicators/)

Engineering KPIs:

- Days with no deploys. Goal: 0. You want to deploy as much as possible
- Lead time
- Mean-Time-To-Restore (MTTR) - The average time it takes to recover from a service outage, failed deploy, or incident, Mean-Time-To-Restore (MTTR) is a great operational metric because beyond pure availability metrics (which are also critical), it measures a kind of resilience in the face of failures.
- NPS score. Ask developers how much they would recommend their team to a fellow developer.
