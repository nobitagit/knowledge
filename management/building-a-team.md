Unrelated - lots of interesting articles from Gallup on management https://www.google.com/search?q=gallup+managers&oq=gallup+managers&aqs=chrome..69i64j69i57.5026j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8

- define your core values
- define levels of your engineering team
- structure hiring for predictability and speed
- when hiring, always [define what you're looking for](https://asana.com/eng/interview-guide)

## Example of engineering values

> When you work together with other people in a team, and they care about what the team is doing and the team is somehow successful, you probably already share some unsaid values among the members of this team.

From Pluralsight's ["Hiring, Firing, and Inspiring an Exceptional Team: CodeMash"](https://app.pluralsight.com/course-player?clipId=fd125e12-2e25-40a5-a750-db222264cfe4)

To build a successful team:

- hire team players that share your core values
- design the alliance
- regular 1:1s

## Hire team players that share your core values

- Hire people that share the core values of the organisation and - especially - your team ones.
- You should be able to ask a team member if a decision they took aligns or not with the team's core values. If not, you have work to do
- exceptional teams always have a #no-assholes rule

## Design the alliance

GOAL: Ensure you know how to communicate effectively with that person. This helps preventing or solving problems.

See [here](https://www.anneloehr.com/2017/12/14/managers-do-this-first/)

- When you hire a new person, ask how they like to communicate.
  - Do you like frequent checkins?
  - Do you like shorter regular updates or longer and more infrequent?
  - Do you prefer email or chat?
- How do you deal with deadlines?
- Ask for a personality assessment (Myers Briggs or similar)
- Tell them how you measure success
- How can I know if you're stressed/upset
- Trust them. If there are 2 or 3 possible routes, openly trust they will take the right one. ["Do whatever you feel is right"](./the-way-we-work.md). This is **not a sign of weakness**.

**TAKE NOTES ABOUT THEIR ANSWERS**

## Regular 1:1s

Listen to [this](https://www.manager-tools.com/2005/07/the-single-most-effective-management-tool-part-1) podcast.

- it should **not be a status report**!!!
- Split like:
  - 10 minutes their agenda
  - 10 minutes your agenda
  - 10minutes flex
- You want to be a person they can ask personal/non-work advice to (this correlates with engaged employees), hence..
- Ask also personal stuff
- Ensure they feel they're growing and have the tools to learn
- Give feedback (prepare it and provide it with data)
- When giving feedback ask for their way of seeing those points
- Declare how "change/better looks like"

Ideas for questions:

- what's on your mind (their agenda)
- what work are you doing here that is most inline with your goals?
- how can we improve the company?
- who in team you work best with? Who in the team you work worse?

## Use DISC

Dominance, Influence, Steadiness, Conscientiousness.

https://www.123test.com/disc-personality-test/

This highlights areas where you can improve or rather focus on.
Also helps to know how to deal with a person.

My result is https://www.123test.com/disc-personality-test/id=fOVETWZPZ9LA6N5&version=

- 33% Compliance
- 26% Steadiness
- 26% Dominance
- 15% Influence

- Dominance: Describes the way you deal with problems, assert yourself and control situations.
- Influence: Describes the way you deal with people, the way you communicate and relate to others.
- Steadiness: Describes your temperament - patience, persistence, and thoughtfulness
- Compliance: Describes how you approach and organize your activity, procedures and responsibilities.

> You act in an assertive, diplomatic way and strive for a stable, ordered life. You are goal orientated but tend to avoid risk taking. You handle pressure well - you push yourself and expect others to do the same
