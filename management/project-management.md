2.  By Complexity:

In the backlog or ready to do have one column each for:

- Obvious
- Complicated
- Complex
- Chaotic

3. By unknowns (how scary a task is)

In the backlog or ready to do have one column each for:

- Not much
- Some
- Lots

4. By preference

In the backlog or ready to do have one column each for:

- hate it
- whatever
