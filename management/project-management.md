### Notes from Personal Kanban by Jim Benson

Notes from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P879lsFjars), from [this presentation](https://pmiswmo.starchapter.com/images/August_2017_PMI_Meeting_-_Personal_Kanban.pdf) and from [this summary](https://github.com/keyvanakbary/learning-notes/blob/master/books/personal-kanban.md)

#### How to prioritise a Kanban board

Many options:

1. By Priority:

In the backlog or ready to do have one column each for P1, P2, P3

2.  By Complexity:

In the backlog or ready to do have one column each for:

- Obvious
- Complicated
- Complex
- Chaotic

3. By unknowns (how scary a task is)

In the backlog or ready to do have one column each for:

- Not much
- Some
- Lots

4. By preference

In the backlog or ready to do have one column each for:

- hate it
- whatever
- love it

TODO: research more on this one

> Kaizen is a state of continuous improvement where people naturally look for ways to improve poorly performing practices.
>
> When we visualise our work, we adopt a kaizen mindset; we are weened from the comfort of complacency and actively seek out opportunities for improvement.

#### Establish a WIP limit

Pick a number (can be quasi-random and adjusted as you go) and set it as the maximum of allowed tickets in WIP
