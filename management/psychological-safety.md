# Psychological Safety

This is a leadership responsibility and only works when tied with setting high standards.
A study from Google declared PS as the #1 to a successful team (see [here](https://rework.withgoogle.com/blog/five-keys-to-a-successful-google-team/)).

A team of excellent engineers will never overachieve if the team dynamics don't allow for PS to exist.

## How to measure the PS of a team

Survey with a 5 point Likert scale:

1. If you make a mistake on this team, it is often held against you. (R)
2. Members of this team are able to bring up problems and tough issues.
3. People on this team sometimes reject others for being different. (R)
4. It is safe to take a risk on this team.
5. It is difficult to ask other members of this team for help. (R)
6. No one on this team would deliberately act in a way that undermines my efforts.
7. Working with members of this team, my unique skills and talents are valued and utilized.

This is a good one for quarterly offsites.

Note that three of the seven items are expressed positively, such that agreement indicates greater psychological safety, and three are expressed negatively (represented in Figure 1.2 with an “R” for reverse), such that disagreement is consistent with higher psychological safety. In analyzing the data, therefore, it is important to “reverse score” data from the negatively worded items, where a 1 in the data set is converted to a 7, a 7 to a 1, a 2 to a 6, and so on.
