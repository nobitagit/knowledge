## Compounding

Taking the interest gained on an investment and re-investing this portion into the same investment.

If you invert 10k in with 10% yearly return, here's the y.o.y. breakdown of the first 5 years.

| year | capital | interest |
-------|---------|-----------
| 1    | 11,000  | 1,000    |
| 2    | 12,000  | 1,000    |
| 3    | 13,000  | 1,000    |
| 4    | 14,000  | 1,000    |
| 5    | 15,000  | 1,000    |

With compounding:

| year | capital | interest |
-------|---------|-----------
| 1    | 11,000  | 1,000    |
| 2    | 12,100  | 1,100    |
| 3    | 13,310  | 1,210    |
| 4    | 14,641  | 1,331    |
| 5    | 16,105  | 1,464    |

So, we re-invest the interest each time to allow for compounding to take effect.
In 5 year the difference is between 15k and over 16k.

## Private vs Public corps

A **private corp** usually starts as a business with one person running and owning 100% of the business.
If Bob's business generates 100k a year, Bob gets to keep it all.

When Bob decides to grow the business he calculates he needs 2 millions. At this rate Bob will need 20+ years to grow enough capital. A possibility is to sell a percentage of the business, say 50%, to raise money and invest into growing.

If everything goes well, in 1 year the business grows so that it can generate 500k a year vs the original 100k.
Even if he indeed owns "less" of the company, the company now is worth more than originally, so Bob has actually increased his net worth even though he owns less shares.

While this works, it doesn't scale very well, because:

- finding an investor is time consuming
- Bob needs to vet the investor and trust them
- the investor needs to vet Bob and his business
- the paperwork takes time and is generally quite complex
- the value of the company is not easy to be determined and there's no arbitrage in place. Bob and the investor have to find **an agreement**

Going **public** streamlines this process. An investor buying shares:

- trusts that the revenue and financial info of the companies are truthful
- a public corp has to be audited every 3 months
- auditors certify that the books are correct

## IPO

An IPO is the process of bringing a company from private to public.
To do an IPO you need one or more **underwriters**, firms that specialise in bringing corps from private to public.
An underwriter:

- checks the books
- checks the future plans of the corp
- check the market prospects

They will then make an estimate like: "by selling 80% of the corp you can raise X amount of money"

NOTE: The number of shares of arbitrary and can be changed in time. Bob can decide to split the corp in 20000 shares or 7500000. Nothing really changes in terms of valuation.

So after the underwriters have done their analysis they strike a price per share and then contact big investors, big insurance firms and offer them part of the shares. This is the **primary market**.

Then, the shares are offered to the public for free trade. This is when the company actually goes public, by being traded in the **secondary market**.
