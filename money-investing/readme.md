## Compounding

Taking the interest gained on an investment and re-investing this portion into the same investment.

If you invert 10k in with 10% yearly return, here's the y.o.y. breakdown of the first 5 years.

| year | capital | interest |
-------|---------|-----------
| 1    | 11,000  | 1,000    |
| 2    | 12,000  | 1,000    |
| 3    | 13,000  | 1,000    |
| 4    | 14,000  | 1,000    |
| 5    | 15,000  | 1,000    |

With compounding:

| year | capital | interest |
-------|---------|-----------
| 1    | 11,000  | 1,000    |
| 2    | 12,100  | 1,100    |
| 3    | 13,310  | 1,210    |
| 4    | 14,641  | 1,331    |
| 5    | 16,105  | 1,464    |

So, we re-invest the interest each time to allow for compounding to take effect.
In 5 year the difference is between 15k and over 16k.
