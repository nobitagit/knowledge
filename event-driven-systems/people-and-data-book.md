# People and data

[Tom Redman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomredman/) book notes.

- Data imprtance is growing every day, but it's very hard to put it at work. Moreover, there's a lot of bad data around that increases the noise and reduces the effetiveness of people. _Better management of data is THE management challenge of the 21st Century_.

- It is very hard to sustain a competitve advantage based solely on technology. Any competitor can buy the same technology. But the data of a company is unique to itself _It is THE differentiator._

- A company can't do much with its data without getting as many people as it can fully onboard. Without large numbers of people engaged in the data programme, poor results, even outright failure, is probable. This is why involving **regular people** in the process is key. They are central to all data-related work.

- Yet today, too many companies view people as ‘part of the problem’.

> Everyone thinks about people last, when it is too late to engage them.

It is as if everyone's job has two components:

- their jobs
- dealing with mundane data issues so they can do their jobs

It is a huge waste of talent.

## Involving regular people early on

Never work in isolation.

- Every datascience project should start with the question, ‘Who might be impacted and **how do we get them involved?**'

- Every effort to address data quality must start with the question, "Who touches that data and **how do we get them involved**?"

- Every effort to improve business performance must start with the question, ‘What data do we need to complete this effort and **who do we need to get involved**?’
