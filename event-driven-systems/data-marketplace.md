Notes from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4d0qM5r8l8

- customer data and partner data (for booking.com) are essential as the data need to align. If the partner (accommodation) data doesn't match, there is no value to be returned to the customer.
- metadata management capaibliity has great potential. It also is a hard sell.
