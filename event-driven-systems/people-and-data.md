# People and data

- Most of the data management is done by people who don't have data in their title, have no training, no support, no guidance,  no tool. It's finance people, merchandisers, product developers etc.

- Data is an increasing fraction of our jobs. People do feel empowered when they are given the freedom of working with quality data. 
Nobody wants to clean data (someone else's) themselves, they want to consume it. 

- If you care about generative ai, you should start caring about data and the people that work on it today

- Garbage in, garbage out is still the fundamental law for data quality

- We need to ensure people acknowledge they they are customer of someone else's data, but also creators. They need to feel responsible for it, it's a small conceptual leap, but an important one. Everyone is a customer, many are creators.

- How do we get all the 3k+ people in a company to realise? This is why this is a management challenge first and only after it's a tech challenge.Tech should be there to support this mission.

- There is no piece of infrastructure that will make this happen for you. Without infra this won't happen, but with infra alone, it won't happen either. This is a job that has to be done by people, with people. 

- To make people realise the importance of their work it's important to show the creators what sort of work they make possible, which projects are using a piece of data. 

- From McKinsey https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/designing-data-governance-that-delivers-valuerespondents to our 2019 Global Data Transformation Survey reported that an average of 30 percent of their total enterprise time was spent on non-value-added tasks because of poor data quality and availability

- We manage vertically (mainly by domain) but we reap rewards horizontally. If pricing domain is managed correctly, myself working on merch can reap the rewards, and viceversa. This is a management challenge though, because you only get to see the advantages when multiple domains get onboard and are managed properly.

- If a company wants to improve sales, marketing, customer engagement, customer care, cost, sustainability, speed of go to market, then all these things have one thing in common, and it's data quality.

- It's important to get management onboard first, and then work on the tech side. Tech is there to follow and sustain the Org change. Get the management right first, then the technology will become way more powerful. Tech is how we deliver that change. 

- Data governance should be federated. Centralising data governance, data teams, central tools will not work. Release control is applied to data. 

- As a data leader one has to do is to build political capital. Make things easier for people so they become your **allies**.

- The bottom up work is the initiator of change, but the top down (senior leadership down) is how this work spreads to the wider organisation. 

- A nice side effect of this effort is closing the gap between **analytics and operational pipelines**
