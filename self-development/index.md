## Command respect

- [Set ambitious goals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4w3IyvKvas&list=WL&index=1&t=567s) and work to pursue them

- Talk about what _we_ want, not what _I_ want. (We need to do X because we want to be a great team. We need to Y because everyone here wants to be part of an ambitious team)

- React calmly when the situation is tense

- When you don't have the answers that people expect from you, communicate more. See [this video](https://www.ted.com/talks/amy_c_edmondson_how_to_lead_in_a_crisis?referrer=playlist-the_way_we_work_season_3)

## Handling frustration and avoiding gossiping or negative talk

➡️ Instead of gossiping, vent privately in a structured way:

- Write down your frustrations in a "venting journal."

- Record a voice note (that you delete after).

➡️ Channel the Energy Into Something Productive

Instead of stewing in negativity, turn it into motivation:

- Work on a personal project.

- Tackle a hard problem at work.

- Write a leadership post about handling frustration.

Anger and frustration are physical emotions—burn them off with movement.

- Go for a run, hit the gym, or do a hard cycling session.

- Even a quick walk can reset your mood.

Ask yourself: “Will this matter in 6 months?” (If not, let it go.)

- Don’t vent to direct reports. (It damages your leadership.)

Tell yourself: “I don’t need to gossip because I operate at a higher level.”

1️⃣ Stop Gossiping About Them Immediately (People Will Notice)
2️⃣ Be Neutral & Professional Around Them (No emotional reactions)
3️⃣ If Possible, Find One Genuine Positive Thing About Them (Even a small compliment can change perceptions)
