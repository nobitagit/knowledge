## Command respect

- [Set ambitious goals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4w3IyvKvas&list=WL&index=1&t=567s) and work to pursue them

- Talk about what _we_ want, not what _I_ want. (We need to do X because we want to be a great team. We need to Y because everyone here wants to be part of an ambitious team)

- React calmly when the situation is tense
