# FAST teams

These are notes from reading FAST Agile - Fluid Scaling Technology: for agile and agile at scale

> Self-organisation is the life force of the world, thriving on the edge of chaos with just enough order to funnel its energy.

> - Frederick Laloux

FAST is the acronym for Fluid Scaling Technology.
Fluid Scaling Technology for Agile is FAST Agile.

> We are beginning to see organisations that are learning how to use the power of self-organisation to be more agile and effective.
> They have eliminated rigidity—both physical and psychological— in order to support more fluid processes
> whereby temporary teams are created
> to deal with specific and ever-changing needs.

## FAST Process

- Bring everyone together to work as one Collective.
- Visually represent business goals on a wall.
- Let the Collective self-organise into teams to break down and do the work.
- On a short cadence, synch and repeat the above step.

### The Collective

To transition from static teams to a fluid lattice structure, merge teams into a FAST Collective.

The Collective participates to the FAST Meeting.
The FAST Meeting is a planning and synchronisation event where priorities are highlighted and teams dynamically form around work.

Once teams have assembled, they break away, plan, and deliver what value they can with the remaining time in the cycle.

At the end of the cycle, the Collective comes back together. Each team shares their progress to ensure that everyone in the Collective is in sync with the current state of development and discovery. Making use of the Collective being already gathered, these steps are repeated, and teams again form around work for the next Value Cycle.
