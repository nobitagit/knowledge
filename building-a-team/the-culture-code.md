# The culture code

In the chapter “The Good Apples” from The Culture Code by Daniel Coyle, the author explores the profound impact of positive behavior on team dynamics and culture. The title refers to an experiment where researchers placed an intentionally toxic individual (nicknamed “The Bad Apple”) into various small groups to observe their impact.

Many groups became less effective and cooperative. However, in some groups, the bad apple’s negativity was neutralized or even reversed by a single, positively influential member.

Coyle calls this kind of individual a “Good Apple”— someone who fosters connection, cooperation, and psychological safety within their group. These individuals play a pivotal role in shaping and sustaining a strong, positive team culture by:

    1.	Modeling Proactive Behaviors: They actively engage others, demonstrate warmth and encouragement, and lead by example in fostering inclusiveness.
    2.	Mitigating Negativity: They subtly defuse tension and refocus the team on shared goals without creating additional conflict.
    3.	Reinforcing Positive Norms: Through consistent behavior, they ensure the group’s cultural values remain intact even under stress.

The chapter emphasizes the multiplier effect of positive contributors within teams and encourages leaders to recognize, nurture, and empower these “good apples” to strengthen team dynamics. It also underlines the importance of hiring and promoting individuals who naturally enhance group morale and cohesion.

The broader message is that **culture isn’t shaped solely by top-down directives; it’s often the result of small, deliberate actions by individuals who prioritize connection and collaboration.**

An example is the fact that many high performing groups share these characteristics:

- close physical proximity, often in circles
- high amount of high contact
- physical touch (fist bumps, high fives, handshakes, hugs)
- everyone talks to everyone, not just to the leader
- members sometimes break out of the conversation, do some research and come back to the group with more information
- people share a future together, they talk about it
- short, frequent speeches (no long ones)
- few interruptions
- lots of questions
- active listening
- humour, laughter
- small, attentive courtesies (opening doors, thank yous)

These are all belonging cues, that signals to the other that they are part of the group. These are subtle signals that need to be **continuous** to **reassure the receiver that they are indeed safe in the team**.

Our brains are hardwired to recognise danger, so we need to constantly reasssure it that we are indeed safe.

The group chemistry is very apparent, tangible.
They are also quite addictive, external people want to be part of that group.
