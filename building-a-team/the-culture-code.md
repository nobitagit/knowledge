# The culture code

In the chapter “The Good Apples” from The Culture Code by Daniel Coyle, the author explores the profound impact of positive behavior on team dynamics and culture. The title refers to an experiment where researchers placed an intentionally toxic individual (nicknamed “The Bad Apple”) into various small groups to observe their impact.

Many groups became less effective and cooperative. However, in some groups, the bad apple’s negativity was neutralized or even reversed by a single, positively influential member.

Coyle calls this kind of individual a “Good Apple”— someone who fosters connection, cooperation, and psychological safety within their group. These individuals play a pivotal role in shaping and sustaining a strong, positive team culture by:

    1.	Modeling Proactive Behaviors: They actively engage others, demonstrate warmth and encouragement, and lead by example in fostering inclusiveness.
    2.	Mitigating Negativity: They subtly defuse tension and refocus the team on shared goals without creating additional conflict.
    3.	Reinforcing Positive Norms: Through consistent behavior, they ensure the group’s cultural values remain intact even under stress.

The chapter emphasizes the multiplier effect of positive contributors within teams and encourages leaders to recognize, nurture, and empower these “good apples” to strengthen team dynamics. It also underlines the importance of hiring and promoting individuals who naturally enhance group morale and cohesion.

The broader message is that **culture isn’t shaped solely by top-down directives; it’s often the result of small, deliberate actions by individuals who prioritize connection and collaboration.**

An example is the fact that many high performing groups share these characteristics:

- close physical proximity, often in circles
- high amount of high contact
- physical touch (fist bumps, high fives, handshakes, hugs)
- everyone talks to everyone, not just to the leader
- members sometimes break out of the conversation, do some research and come back to the group with more information
- people share a future together, they talk about it
- short, frequent speeches (no long ones)
- few interruptions
- lots of questions
- active listening
- humour, laughter
- small, attentive courtesies (opening doors, thank yous)

These are all belonging cues, that signals to the other that they are part of the group. These are subtle signals that need to be **continuous** to **reassure the receiver that they are indeed safe in the team**.

Our brains are hardwired to recognise danger, so we need to constantly reasssure it that we are indeed safe.

The group chemistry is very apparent, tangible.
They are also quite addictive, external people want to be part of that group.

## The Role of Vulnerability

Leaders and team members can foster belonging by openly showing vulnerability. Admitting mistakes, asking for help, or sharing personal challenges encourages others to do the same, creating a safe environment where trust thrives.

## Over-Communication of Safety

Coyle highlights that successful teams often over-communicate their commitment to one another. This can include repeated reassurance of shared goals and mutual support, especially during challenging times.

## How to build belonging

The book highlights NBA coach Gregg Popovich of the San Antonio Spurs as a master of building trust, connection, and a strong team culture. Popovich is known for creating an environment where players feel deeply valued, respected, and unified.

Key Points About Popovich’s Leadership Style:

1. **The Balance of Tough Love and Deep Care**

Popovich is famous for being both brutally honest and profoundly caring. He doesn’t shy away from giving hard feedback, but he balances it with genuine, personal care for his players. He makes a concerted effort to know them as people, learning about their families, interests, and cultures. This dual approach creates a strong sense of trust and respect.
• Example: After tough feedback or a heated moment during a game, he often follows up with gestures of care, like sharing a meal or offering encouragement. Players know his intensity comes from a place of genuine investment in their growth and success.

2. **Connecting Through Food and Conversation**

Popovich uses shared meals as a key tool for building connection. He is known for hosting elaborate team dinners, where players and staff come together to bond over food and conversation. These meals are more than just social events—they create a sense of belonging and deepen relationships across the team.

3. **Creating a Culture of Belonging**

Popovich instills a sense of purpose and inclusion by emphasizing the values of humility, teamwork, and mutual respect. He makes it clear that every player and staff member is a vital part of the team’s success, regardless of their role.

4. **Fostering Vulnerability and Accountability**

Popovich models vulnerability by showing his own humanity. He doesn’t hesitate to admit when he’s made a mistake or to ask for input from players and staff. This openness fosters psychological safety and encourages team members to hold themselves accountable while supporting one another.

5. **Celebrating Shared Values and Bigger Purposes**

Popovich emphasizes lessons that go beyond basketball. He regularly discusses history, culture, and global issues with his team, encouraging them to think about their broader responsibilities as people. This focus on shared values and purpose strengthens the team’s unity and connection.

Why It Works:

Coyle uses Popovich as a case study for high-purpose environments where trust and belonging drive success. Popovich’s combination of emotional intelligence, consistent small signals of care, and a focus on team-first principles has helped the Spurs maintain one of the most successful records in NBA history.

Takeaway:

Popovich’s leadership underscores that strong team cultures are built on trust, vulnerability, and a deep sense of care. His example demonstrates how fostering connection and shared purpose can translate into sustained excellence, both on and off the court.

## Tony Hsieh, former CEO of Zappos, and how to build for belonging

- Tony Hsieh relies a lot on creating connections
- First, for himself, by knowing and talking with anyone in the company
- Then, for others, by creating connections, introducing people to one another

An example, on the first day of a new joiner, the only thing he said was to **talk to these 8 people**.

## Why distance matters

Proximity of team members is highly correlated with success.
Distance below 8 metres skyrockets communication.
Being on different floors is practically like being remote.

## How to build for safety

- overly communicate (non verbally) that you are listening
- no interruptions, unless for the oocasional joke or burst of enthusiasm
- as a leader, admit your fears and weknesses, as they invite people to chime in and help
- as a leader, ask for input. "What do you think?", "What would you do?"
