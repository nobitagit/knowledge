# Team topologies

> The org chart does have its uses in the context of building software systems, specifically around regulatory and legal compliance. However, in a highly collaborative context filled with uncertainty over outcomes, relying on the org chart as a principal mechanism of splitting the work to be done leads to unrealistic expectations

- an org chart is always out of sync with reality
- org charts do not represent the real communication paths that exist
- org charts make restructuring perceived as scary

## Conway Law

“Organizations which design systems [...] are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations"

> A sort of “revival” of Conway’s law took place around 2015, when microservices architectures were on the rise. In particular, James Lewis, Technical Director at Thoughtworks, and others came up with the idea of applying an “inverse Conway maneuver” (or reverse Conway maneuver), whereby an organization focuses on organizing team structures to match the architecture they want the system to exhibit rather than expecting teams to follow a mandated architecture design

- thinking of software architecture as a standalone concept that can be designed in isolation and then implemented by any group of teams is fundamentally wrong
