# Speaking and Presenting

## Reverse the gesture for the past and future

- right -> past
- left -> future

This is because it appears more natural for the listener, as they will see it reversed.

## Use Blank slides
So you are able to stand in front of the slides. To do so, while in presenter mode, press "." or "b".
This focuses the attention on you, shifting it away from the slides.
If you are in person, stand in front of the slide to take more space.

## Hand position and gestures
- Hands on the belly button

> One way to stand and look professional as well as engaged is to play rock, paper, scissors with yourself. Hand (paper) covers your other hand (rock), then rest your hands on your stomach, right above the belly button. It should be like you’re about to give yourself the Heimlich maneuver, but don’t go that far. This helps you keep your hands at rest while also making you look poised and confident.

- Use open hands, elbows away from the body

## Looking at the audience
Pick a person in the audience, deliver a message/sentence to them, then pick another person.
This allows you to distribute the attention to the whole audience.

## Pick a descriptive title and description
The title can be outcome

## How to spark interaction or attention
- ask Y/N questions
- say something unexpected or out the norm. Like: instead of saying "there are 3 reasons for that", say "there are 2 1/2 reasons for that"

## Setup for a remote presentation
- camera at eye level
- background must not be blank. Have stuff there, like furniture, a picture, some soft light
- front lights should remove shadows from the face
- face should end 2 fingers from the top of the frame
- take some distance from the camera. Make sure your hands are visible when using them

Draw this diagram on a piece of paper and start filling in the points.

- S = Set the sence
- T -> O = Threat to Desired Outocome
- R = Route
- I = Initial step. What is the easiest step the audience needs to take to follow up

## 1. Set the scene

Connect yourself to the topic. 
Why should people listen to you?
Why are you relevant in this topic, or this story?
Highlight either your role, or experience.

Either:

a. talk about your function
b. talk about the benefits of listening to you. 

The best is if the audience sees that listening to you will benefit them.

## 2. Threat/ (Desired) Outcome

Position the goal. What is the final goal in this story? What does success look like? What is the thing that threatens the best outcome?

## 3. Route

What are the steps to success, how will you get to the end of the story?
Make it at most 3 steps

## 4. Initial step
What's the first LOGICAL step that the audience needs to take to follow up successfully? How can they leverage the key take-aways of the presentation?
