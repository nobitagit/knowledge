# Low Code AI

Notes from the Book Low Code AI.

The ML workflow starts with defining a specific question or problem with a defined boundary.
In this phase you are attempting to define scope and feasibility. The right question will lead you to what data is required and potential ways data must be prepared.

It is important to note that any question that may arise in analyzing data can be grouped in one of the five ML categories:

| Algorithm/Model            | Explanation                                                                                                              | Example                                                                        |
| :------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Regression**             | Predicts a continuous numerical value.                                                                                   | Predicting house prices or temperature.                                        |
| **Classification**         | Categorizes data into predefined classes or labels.                                                                      | Identifying if an email is spam or not, or classifying images as cats or dogs. |
| **Clustering**             | Groups similar data points together based on their inherent characteristics, without predefined labels.                  | Segmenting customers into different market groups.                             |
| **Anomaly Detection**      | Identifies rare or unusual data points that deviate significantly from the norm.                                         | Detecting fraudulent transactions or system failures.                          |
| **Reinforcement Learning** | Trains an agent to make a sequence of decisions by interacting with an environment, learning from rewards and penalties. | Training a robot to navigate a maze or an AI to play a game.                   |
