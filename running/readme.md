## How to calculate your paces if you're unsure

Use [this](https://www.omnicalculator.com/sports/training-pace).
Put in a recent running result and calculate your paces.
Based on a 1.34 HM:

- Easy run: 5:13 / km
- Tempo run 4:20 / km
- VO2 max run: 3:54 / km
- Speed run: 3:37 / km
- Long run: 5:54 / km


## How to test your MHR (Max heart rate)

- You need to be well rested. See [this source](https://youtu.be/lmB5cTOWCbs?t=330). You won't be able to hit your MHR when tired.
- Inclination doesn't matter. See [here](https://youtu.be/lmB5cTOWCbs?t=626)

## Tempo run

Use the best pace you can sustain for 60 minutes.
Or 30 minutes as hard as you can, in training.
The average pace is the tempo pace.

## Some random facts

- Most running injuries are repetitive strain injuries. Injuries can be avoided/reduced by running with 2 different types of shoes. [Source](https://youtu.be/gmBz3QC5JAg?t=129)

## How to build a training plan

See [this video](https://youtu.be/D4G39xnkkS0?t=108)

- S&C should take up around 25% of the weekly training time. It avoids injuries and gets the most out of the training.

## How to increase your weekly running distance (and improve race times)

From [this article](https://www.trainingpeaks.com/blog/how-to-increase-your-marathon-training-mileage/).

### Run more frequently

- Work towards adding 1 day per week
- It's ok to start with only a 4 or 5km run
- Once you run 6 or 7 days a week, think about doubling some runs. For instance, you can run twice every Tuesday.

### Do a second long(er) run each week.

- Not as long as the main long run
- May include a faster pace portion
- Sandwich this within easy days (or an easy and a rest day)

For example:

- a 20k with kms 17, 18, 19 each one 15 seconds faster than the preceding one
- a 18k with the 8kms in the middle each one that start with a 30 seconds surge to 10k pace, then the rest of the km normal, easy and steady pace

### Increase base runs distance

This should be done extremely gradually and when not increasing long runs.
Consider though that:

>  Beginners should spend several years building a solid base with 20-, 30- and 40-mile (~65k) weeks. Only then should you consider building your weekly mileage to 50 or 60 miles or more.
