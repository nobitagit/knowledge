## Glossary

- MTP: marathon time performance

## Explanation

> Tanda (2011) proposed a correlation between MPT and training indices recorded over an 8-week training period ending one week preceding the race
>
> Tanda reported that the training indices most highly correlated to MPT were the mean **training distance run per week K** and the **mean training pace P**. These two parameters were combined mathematically to give a prediction of the **mean marathon pace Pm**:

```
Pm (sec/km) = 17.1 + 140.0 exp[-0.0053 K(km/week)] + 0.55 P (sec/km)
```
