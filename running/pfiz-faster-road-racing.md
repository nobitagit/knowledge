# Faster road racing

These are my notes from reading the book [Faster Road Racing, 5K to Half Marathon](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Pete-Pfitzinger/dp/1450470459) by Pete Pfizinger.

My data:

- MHR 195
- RHR 42
- Threshold pace: 04:48 (10 Oct 2021)
- Threshold HR: 176bpm (17 nov 2021)

## Long runs or endurance

**Effort** should be one of:

a. between 74 and 84% of max heart rate
b. between 65 and 78% of HRR (heart rate reserve, [here's how to calculate](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/in-depth/exercise-intensity/art-20046887#:~:text=Calculate%20your%20heart%20rate%20reserve,heart%20rate%20to%20this%20number.))
c. between 20 and 30% slower than 10K pace
d. between 17 and 29% slower than HM pace

Based on a MHR of 195bpm and RHR of 42bpm this equates to:

a. 144bpm to 163bpm
b. (195-42) * 0,65 + 42 = **141** to (195-42) * 0,78 + 42 = **161** (note that the resting heart rate is added after calculating the %)
c. 4.15/km => 5:20 - 6:00
d. 4.25/km => 5:12 - 6:10

This should roughly equate to somewhere between zone 2 and 3.
The long run should start at the slower end of the provided % and finish in the faster end.
This means that for method c. you would start just below 6min/k pace and progress gradually to finish at 5:20/5:15 pace.

## Progression long runs

Start at same starting pace as long runs and increase up to lactate threshold pace for the last 5 to 4k.
