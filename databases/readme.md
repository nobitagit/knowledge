## How does a relational database work

### Time complexity

As you probably know:

- time complexity is used to see how long an algorithm will take for a given amount of data
- it can be expressed using bigO notation

With a low amount of data, the difference between O(1) and O(n2) is negligible. For example, letâ€™s say you have an algorithm that needs to process 2000 elements.

- An O(1) algorithm will cost you 1 operation
- An O(log(n)) algorithm will cost you 7 operations
- An O(n) algorithm will cost you 2 000 operations
- An O(n*log(n)) algorithm will cost you 14 000 operations
- An O(n2) algorithm will cost you 4 000 000 operations
